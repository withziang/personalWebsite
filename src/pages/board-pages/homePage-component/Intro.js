            <em>Hi, I am Ziang Wang. </em>
            I am currently a McGill University Software Engineering Student.
            I am skilled in computer programming and photography.
            Started to participate in all kinds of Math competitions since youth,
            I have acquired many question-solving techniques and knowledge.
            I invest most of my spare time in studying extra math and physics.
            In recent years, I self-taught myself many advanced topics in Topology,
            Number Theory, and Functional Analysis.
            My Math competition background acts countless times as a valuable asset in my computer programming career.
